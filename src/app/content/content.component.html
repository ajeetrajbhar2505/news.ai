        CNN â€” As severe storms prompted at least nine tornado reports in parts of the central US, a barrage of snow, rain and harsh wind was forecast Monday in places from the West Coast to the Great Lakes, including some still without power following a similar string of severe weather last week.

        More than 216,000 US homes and businesses were without power as of Monday evening, according to <a href="#">PowerOutage.us</a>. More than two-thirds of the outages were in Michigan, where a previous ice storm damaged trees and utility lines. Almost 55,000 outages were reported in California.

        In Oklahoma, almost 10 tornadoes and 12 injuries were reported in severe weather on Sunday. Tornadoes were also reported in Kansas and Texas.
